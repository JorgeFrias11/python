# 1st Project M-Tech

This was my first project while I was learning Python back in September 2020, as part of the Data Science programme of Banco Santander-EM-Tech.
It simulates a simple store management system and was designed to practice core programming concepts. 

The program includes:
- User registration and login.
- Admin access: Administrators have special access to view different reports.
- Reports and statistics of sold products. 

The project was built entirely with Python basics (loops, conditionals, lists) without using external libraries, in order to practice logic, algorithms, and data handling.
