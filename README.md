# 1st Project M-Tech

This was my first project while I was learning Python.
It simulates a simple store management system.

The program includes:
- User registration and login.
- Admin access: Administrators have special access to view different reports.
- Reports and statistics of sold products. 

The project was built entirely with Python basics (loops, conditionals, lists) without using external libraries, in order to practice logic, algorithms, and data handling.
